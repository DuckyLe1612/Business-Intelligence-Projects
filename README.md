# End-to-End Data Projects


These are projects I've completed as part of my learning journey in data analytics and business intelligence. I’ve used tools like **Tableau**, **Power BI**, **Excel**, and **Python** to complete these projects, with a focus on end-to-end solutions that cover everything from data cleaning to creating interactive dashboards and predictive models.

These projects were initially inspired by tutorials, but I’ve gone beyond simply following along. I applied the concepts I learned to adapt and customize the work to fit specific problems. This allowed me to deepen my understanding and gain valuable insights into using these tools to solve real-world problems.

HR Dashboard Details: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/duckyle/viz/HRDetailsDashboard-Ducky/HRDetails

For this project, I created a fully interactive HR analytics dashboard in **Tableau** based on a simulated user story. Using a synthetic HR dataset of 8,950 records, I designed the dashboard to help HR managers make data-driven decisions regarding workforce management.

- Developed interactive views, including:
  - **Overview**: Trends in hiring and termination, department breakdowns.
  - **Demographics**: Insights into age, gender, education levels, and performance ratings.
  - **Income Analysis**: Comparison of salary across age, education, and gender.
  
- Added filtering and drill-down features, allowing users to explore employee data based on various factors such as department and demographics.

I performed a comprehensive analysis of Blinkit’s sales data, focusing on performance metrics, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution. I applied **DAX** formulas and advanced techniques to generate valuable insights for stakeholders.

- Created interactive dashboards with KPIs:
  - Total Sales, Average Sales, Number of Items, and Average Rating.
  
- Designed visualizations like:
  - **Donut charts** for sales by fat content.
  - **Bar charts** comparing sales performance by item type.
  - **Funnel maps** to illustrate sales by outlet location.

- Generated insights and actionable recommendations to optimize product offerings and outlet strategies.

I developed a comprehensive dashboard to analyze patient wait lists across inpatient and outpatient categories. The goal was to assist healthcare administrators in optimizing patient flow and reducing waiting times by providing actionable insights based on key performance metrics.

## Features

- **Developed interactive dashboards with key metrics:**
  - **Average Waiting Time** and **Median Waiting Time** for both inpatient and outpatient categories.
  - **Current Total Waitlist** to monitor the number of patients on the waiting list.

- **Created visualizations like:**
  - **Line charts** to analyze historical monthly trends in patient wait times.
  - **Bar charts** to compare waiting times by specialty and patient age group.
  - **Heatmaps** to highlight peak and low waiting times during specific periods.

## Insights & Impact

Generated insights to identify critical bottlenecks, enabling healthcare administrators to make informed decisions on resource allocation and patient care strategies.

For this project, I built a dynamic dashboard in **Excel** to analyze road accident data sourced from Kaggle. This project involved cleaning the data and creating customizations based on accident severity, vehicle types, and time of day.

- Utilized **Pivot Tables** and **Excel functions** for in-depth analysis of accident trends.
  
- Designed interactive visualizations, including:
  - **Pie charts**, **bar charts**, and **line charts** to display metrics like accident distribution and severity.
  - **Gauge charts** to track KPIs for a clear overview of accident-related data.

- Worked with stakeholders to define project requirements and deliver a solution that allows users to explore data by factors like vehicle type, road conditions, and geographical location.

## 5. Airbnb Revenue Prediction | **EDA & Linear Regression - Python** | 2025
In this **Python** project, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and built linear regression models to predict Airbnb revenue based on key features from a provided dataset.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis & Data Cleaning**:
  - Handled missing values, removed outliers using IQR, and performed feature engineering to prepare the data for modeling.
  
- **Model Building & Evaluation**:
  - Built and evaluated linear regression models to predict revenue, assessing performance with **R²** and **RMSE**.
  - Used **Plotly** to visualize model predictions and performance.

- **Impact of Outliers on Prediction**:
  - Compared model accuracy before and after outlier removal to assess the effect of outliers on prediction performance.

## Learning Approaches
I’ve focused on mastering these tools through end-to-end projects, as I’ve been advised to complete 3-5 projects per tool before creating my own. The inspiration for many of these projects came from tutorials, but I have personalized them to suit real-world use cases, adapting workflows, implementing new features, and extending the scope to deepen my skills.

I believe this hands-on learning approach, guided by structured tutorials and self-exploration, has allowed me to gain both technical knowledge and problem-solving abilities. I’m now confident in using **Tableau**, **Power BI**, and **Excel** to build end-to-end projects and apply these tools in professional settings.
